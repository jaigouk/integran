"""DISABLED: Tests for src/main.py terminal UI (placeholder implementation).

These tests are for the planned terminal UI implementation in src/main.py.
Currently, src/main.py contains placeholder/stub implementations for the future
terminal interface. The tests are disabled until the full terminal UI framework
is implemented.

When Terminal UI is implemented:
1. Rename this file back to test_main.py
2. Update imports to match final implementation
3. Fix test assertions for actual functionality vs placeholders
4. Remove placeholder behavior tests

To re-enable: mv tests/test_main.py.disabled tests/test_main.py
